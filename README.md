# **Lighting Tutorial**

This was a tutorial I created for the purpose of showing students how the lighting and postprocessing systems work, including how to change different settings to affect the lighting, how light probes work and how post processing can be used to create interesting lighting and affect the tone and mood of a scene. The project was shared with them so they could play around with the lighting system as well.
